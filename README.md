# Welcome to crypt-quizzer

This app was built for the DevJam '24 event organized by the **CC Club, MNNIT Allahabad**. This app incorporates the use of Solidity for making smart contracts.
Users can host, attempt, and win ethereum by playing the quizzes. The top three scorers get a share of the prizepool, along with the host. 
Right now, the smart contracts are not yet linked with the app interface, but we hope to flesh out this app's funtionality as soon as possible. 

## The tech stack used: 
- React.js
- Bootstrap CSS
- Express.js
- Mongoose
- Node.js
- Solidity
- Hardhat
- ether.js
- Sepolia testnet
- Metamask

Note: the main branch does not contain smart contracts. To view them go to the other branches.
